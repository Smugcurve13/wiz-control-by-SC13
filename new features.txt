Small Features to Tackle First:
Custom Light Presets:

Allow users to save and name favorite settings (e.g., "Reading Mode," "Relax Mode") and apply them with a single click.
Light Timer:

Add a feature to schedule when the light should turn on or off (e.g., "Turn off in 30 minutes" or "Turn on at 7 PM").
Group Control:

If you have multiple WiZ lights, allow control of multiple bulbs at once (e.g., "Turn all lights on" or adjust brightness for all).
Real-Time Sync:

Implement WebSocket or Server-Sent Events to reflect real-time changes if the app is being controlled from multiple devices.
Dark Mode for UI:

Add a toggle for dark mode to make the app more visually versatile.
Medium-Sized Additions:
Voice Control Integration:

Add integration with Google Assistant, Alexa, or Siri shortcuts for voice commands.
Custom RGB Picker:

Add a more interactive color picker (e.g., a color wheel) instead of just the input field for RGB values.
Power Usage Stats:

Display estimated power consumption based on brightness and color settings.
Mobile-Friendly Optimization:

Ensure the app is responsive and works seamlessly on mobile devices.
Preparing for a Long-Term, Always-Running App:
User Authentication:

Add a simple login system to secure the app if accessed outside your local network.
Deployment to a Server:

Use services like Heroku, AWS, or a Raspberry Pi to make the app accessible from anywhere.
Data Persistence:

Use a database to save user preferences, light schedules, and logs of light usage.
API Endpoints:

Expose an API so you (or others) can programmatically control your lights.
Event Automations:

Integrate with APIs like IFTTT to trigger light changes based on events (e.g., weather, calendar reminders).
